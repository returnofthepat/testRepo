Emacs report
tools:
	Replace/Find Feature works very well/is quite intuitive.
	You can search the web from inside the editor which is neat but I dont see the appeal of this, as reading information on a deciated web browser looks better and is second nature to interact with. The main issues I ran into was working with the buffers and compiling the code. I think after a while I could get used to working with buffers and even becoming proficent in my knowledge of their use. Additionally the compiling was entirely straight foraward, but once I was using gdb to attempt to debug, compiling became easier(but still not completly intuitive).

productivity curve:
	     Inistially i had a notion that emacs would be quite difficult to code in for extened periods of time, however after coding for a little while longer I was able to sink into a nice flow of interacting with the editor, even finding the tools easier to use. I belive that emacs is a nice code editors however there are still some gaps in my knowledge while using emacs that cause a slowed productivity curve while using the editor, I think over time this would no longer be the case.
